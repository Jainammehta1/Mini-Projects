# Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects I’ve worked on to practice and improve my programming and development skills.

Each project is small but focused on learning a specific concept, solving a simple problem, or building a creative feature using different technologies.

## 💻 Technologies Used

Depending on the project, you’ll find:

- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript

🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is:

To build small hands-on projects
To try out different languages and tools
To gain experience and add to my coding portfolio

I will keep updating this repo as I continue learning.
